Included are records of the Gay Activists Alliance, the Gay Alliance of Brooklyn, Gay Switchboard of New York, the Mattachine Society Inc. of New York, and records of miscellaneous organizations including Christopher Street That New Magazine, Inc., and the periodicals Gaysweek, and New York Native. Personal papers include papers of Lockett Ford Ballard, Jr., Arthur Bell, Billy Wilder Blackwell, Perry Brass, Robert Clement, Don Jackson, Walter Porczak, and Sam Staggs. There are also miscellaneous records of IGIC, including correspondence, minutes, memoranda, photographs of gay rights demonstrations, scripts of plays by gay writers, and printed ephemera issued by gay, lesbian and AIDS organizations in the United States.|||Audiovisual materials include recorded interviews with gay leaders such as Hal (Harold) Call, Curtis Dewees, Franklin Kameny, James Kepner, Morris Kight, Henry (Harry) Hay, Dorr Legg, and Donald Lucas, which chronicle the history of early gay and lesbian organizations such as the Mattachine Society, One, Inc., the Daughters of Bilitis, the Society for Individual Rights, and the Gay Liberation Front. There are also sound recordings of a number of radio and television programs on gay-related issues, most of which were broadcast on Pacifica Radio stations in the early 1980s. These record news and issues of concern to the gay community, such as bias crimes, homophobia, and the spread of AIDS. In addition, the collection includes recordings of lectures, conferences, public forums, and other meetings organized by gay and lesbian groups, some of which include performances by gay entertainers. Most of these gatherings took place in the New York City area in the late 1970s or early 1980s. Audiovisual materials also include television programs (and outtakes) produced in the early 1970s for broadcast on Open Channel, a public access cable channel in New York City. In addition, there are two erotic films, and a documentary entitled, ""A Gay View/Male,"" which was released in 1974.","Biographical or Historical Data Note: The International Gay Information Center, Inc. (IGIC) was founded in New York City in 1982 for the purpose of collecting and preserving historical records and papers which document the movement for gay rights in America. Since its founding the IGIC has collected the records of organizations and the papers of individuals who have been active in the gay rights movement.It has also collected and preserved an extensive file of gay periodicals and imprints; audio-visual materials; and a large mass of printed and near-printed ephemera which document the social and political activities and events of local gay organizations and groups in various cities throughout America.

The documents are all from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, except for a chronology of the history of blacks in Uruguay from 1680-1990.\nIncluded in the official documents are a number of royal decrees concerning the commerce in Africans, the education, treatment and occupation of enslaved laborers, and the liberation of fugitives from the territories of imperial rivals. Other decrees include an 1810 Mexican prohibition against intermarriage between those of ""known nobility and pure blood and blacks, mulattos and other castes"" and an 1812 decree tackling the education of Spanish subjects of African origin in Mexico.\nSignificant in the collection's family papers are the Magan family legal documents which contain a history of an Argentinian family's slave holdings, and records matriarch Inez de Cabrera y Magan's dying wish to grant freedom to her enslaved woman, Josefa. In addition to the Magan family papers, there are a number of other private legal documents that deal with the sale and manumission of enslaved people.\nA 1778 population register of 28 Puerto Rican cities and an 1815 record of the free black population in Buenos Aires offer a demographic picture of colonial Spanish America as do a 1753 Venezuela plantation inventory, a 1775 Cuban population register and a series of handwritten reports regarding maroons in Cuba's Matanzas Province (1837-1838).","Blacks | History | Social conditions | Slavery | Slave trade | Slaves | Enslaved people","","Latin America | Haiti | Argentina | Cuba | Peru | Mexico | Venezuela | Uruguay | West Indies","","","text","correspondence | documents","b18401028","","Sc MG 418","","","","","","",".5 linear feet (2 boxes)","","","",3,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/f7ddf6d0-c608-012f-02d6-58d385a7bc34""26fd6800-c609-012f-dc85-58d385a7bc34",28403,"Stoli︠t︡sa i usadʹba","","",1913,1913,1917,"Russian","","Source Note: Library has: no. 1-90","Art","","Russia","","","still image | text","Periodicals","b16008353","","Slav.

WIllard, who, as a child, collected autographs and photographs of film stars, came to New York after World War II, where he began working as a performer in summer stock. After appearing in a few productions, Willard decided that he did not wish to continue working as a touring actor. Around this time, he began taking photographs with a box camera that his mother had given to him. Willard enjoyed taking photographs of his fellow actors and he used his apartment just off Fifth Avenue as a studio. Willard was most active as a photographer from the late 1940s through the 1960s. His work included portraits of many aspiring and famous actors, actresses, musicians, and dancers, as well as photographs of theatrical productions. Many of Willard's photographs of Off-Broadway productions appeared in the theater annual, Theater World.","Photographers","ANTA (Organization)","United States","","","still image","Photographs","b16093406","","*T-VIM 1999-026","","","","","","NYPT05-A7","34 linear ft (76 boxes)","","","",1,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/b80c29b0-c6c8-012f-397e-58d385a7bc34"

Instructions from C. Rawley, Rear Admiral and Commander-in-Chief of the British fleet in Jamaica, to William Wiseman on a mission to Haiti to negotiate the return of fugitive slaves who had fled there from the Turks Islands salt ponds. Included is a brief letter from Haiti's president Jean-Pierre Boyer, declaring any individual on Haitian soil automatically free and beyond pursuit. Correspondence and other documents of Comte de Leaumont, Saint-Domingue-born ex-plantation owner and president of an association of former French settlers dispossessed by the Haitian revolution, including a memoir by Georges Christophe Wurtz, a medical doctor, ""on the means to repair the harm done to French trade by the insurrection in Saint-Domingue"" (1802-1822). Slave ship La Concorde, 1790-1792: documents related to a legal dispute between a businessman in Cap Français in Saint-Domingue and the captain of the slave ship La Concorde. Toussaint-Louverture correspondence and documents ranging from 1796 to 1802, including a partial register of ordinances and proclamations issued by Toussaint-Louverture as General-in-chief of the army of Saint-Domingue in April 1796, and the text of a November 1801 decree strengthening military order and maintaining the former slaves on the plantations in the aftermath of an insurrection led by his nephew, General Moyse. ""Notes on Saint-Domingue"" (52 p.), a manuscript document written before 1791 giving the physical description of the main towns and localities in the former French colony of Saint-Domingue. Diplomatic correspondence includes 35 letters from the Haitian Legation in Paris to the Haitian Ministry of Foreign Relations, 1911-1914, relating to the purchase of 10,000 guns and 500,000 rounds of ammunition in France, and to a 36-hour British ultimatum to the Haitian government. Also a group of letters from the Haitian Legation in Ciudad Trujillo (Santo Domingo) that give a sense of the general situation between the two countries prior to the October 1937 massacre of 10,000 Haitians in the Dominican Republic. The collection consists of individual items and small groups of Haitian documents mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries. It includes miscellaneous correspondence of Etienne Polvérel and Félicité Sonthonax, members of the Civil Commission sent by the French government to the Windward Islands ""to restore order and tranquillity"" in 1793, and of various Haitian heads of state, among them Nissage Saget (1874), Lysius Félicité Salomon (1883) and Tirésias Simon Sam (1897). Also included are a 1778 inventory listing the names, age, trades and physical condition of 149 slaves on the Beaugé Plantation in the former French colony of Saint-Domingue; a 1785 manumission certificate for Jeanne Aline, a sixteen year-old slave girl; miscellaneous French colonial administration documents ranging from 1791 to 1803; two letters from Henri Christophe to Tobias Lear, U.S. Consul to Saint-Domingue in 1802, and to Corneille Brelle, a French priest appointed Grand Almoner and Archbishop of Haiti in 1811; 1830s Masonic certificates from the Grande Loge d'Haiti; and a group of six autograph letters with attachments from the Haitian surrealist poet Clément Magloire-Saint-Aude (1968-1970).","","Haiti | History","","Haiti | Saint-Domingue","","","text | still image","Documents | Correspondence","b16542740","","Sc MG 119","","","","","","","4 lin. ft","","","",53,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/0c49ab30-c6d1-012f-6c0e-58d385a7bc34""e70163b0-c6d0-012f-9a14-3c075448cc4b",39986,"Africans at home; being a popular description of Africa and the Africans condensed from the accounts of African travellers from the time of Mungo Park to the present day","","Macbrair, R.

Two separate codes, the ""Word Cipher"" discovered by Orville W. Owen and the ""Biliteral Cipher"" discovered by Elizabeth W. Gallup, purport to contain secret messages revealing that Bacon was the son of an undisclosed marriage between Queen Elizabeth I and the Earl of Leicester. In addition, the deciphered messages state that Bacon was the author of works usually attributed to Shakespeare, Robert Burton, Marlowe, and others. George Fabyan, a Chicago businessman, purchased the rights to Owen's work, hired Mrs. Gallup, and established the Riverbank Laboratory in Geneva, Illinois in order to study the codes. Fabyan published studies of cryptography and sold guides to teach the public how to decipher Bacon's code.","Cryptography | Ciphers","Bacon, Francis, 1561-1626 | Burton, Robert, 1577-1640 | Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616 -- Authorship -- Baconian theory","","","","text | still image","Documents","b11628269","","MssCol 176","","","","","","","","","","",5,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/1fb45dc0-7016-0131-0727-58d385a7bbd0""b09b22d0-7174-0131-837d-58d385a7bbd0",41114,"Zur Fauna der Vorwelt ...","","Meyer, Hermann von, 1801-1869",1845,1845,"","","","Note: [Vol. 1] has imprint: Verlag der S.

Correspondence is mainly of Gross and other Board members and staff. Topics include wartime conditions in Europe, plans for postwar reconstruction, and Board matters. Office records contain minutes, reports, notes, and printed matter. Administrative records include by-laws, budgets, financial statements, correspondence, and related items. Also, publications, reports, photographs, reproductions of drawings, caricatures of political figures, and newsclippings.","Biographical or Historical Data Note: The Board was founded in New York in January 1942 by representatives of the exiled governments of occupied Czechoslovakia, Greece, Poland, and Yugoslavia following their attendance at the International Labor Conference held in New York in November 1941. From 1942-1945 it conducted research and formulated plans for postwar reconstruction in the four countries, with the goal of forming a democratic central and eastern European federation. The countries financed the Board with their contributions, and were represented by government ministers: Jan Masaryk (alternating with Jaromir Necas), Czechoslovakia; Emanuel Tsouderos (replacing Aristides Dimitratos, Greece's original representative on the Board), Greece; Jan Stanczyk, Poland; and Sava N. Kosanovich, Yugoslavia. These representatives made up the General Steering Committee (chaired by Kosanovich), the Board's executive body. The Board also had committees on economics (with subcommittees on agriculture, finance and foreign trade, industry, and relief) and education. Feliks Gross was Secretary-General. Gross - lawyer, sociologist, political scientist, author of many books and articles, active in the labor movement in Poland, member of the Polish Socialist Party - was born in Poland in 1906, and came to the United States during the war.\n\nThe Board published the monthly journal New Europe; a monthly newsletter, Survey of Central and Eastern Europe, which reported on wartime conditions in the occupied countries; a pamphlet series; and a series of irregularly issued Documents and Reports. It also participated in institutes, conferences, and other educational forums on the topic of postwar reconstruction in central and Eastern Europe. Many of these were held at colleges and universities in the United States; Antioch College, Hofstra College, New York University, and the University of Wyoming are mentioned frequently.\n\nThe withdrawal Yugoslavia and Greece from the Board in August and September of 1943, respectively; the severance of relations between the Czech and Polish governments; and changes in the political climate which caused Gross to remark: ""... realities are against the ideas which were underlying the foundation of our organization"", (Gross to M. A. de Capriles, Acting Chief, Foreign Agents Registration Section, War Division, Department of Justice, August 3, 1945) all contributed to the closing down of the Board in the Fall of 1945.","","","","","","still image","","b12103184","","MssCol 501","","","","","","","","","","",5,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/14328ee0-a7a2-0131-2f25-58d385a7bbd0""3b592540-ac73-0131-1e79-58d385a7b928",41330,"The Hotel monthly","","Willy, John",1893,1893,1962,"English","","Date/Sequential Designation Note: Library has: v. 5, no. 46-v. 54, no. 645, v. 58, no. 682-v. 59, no. 705 (1897-1946, 1950-51)","Bars (Drinking establishments)","","","","","text | still image","Periodicals","b15016071","","KBB (Hotel monthly)","","","","","","1680792","v. ill.

He was secretary and chief surveyor for the commission responsible for laying out streets and roads in the City of New York, as appointed by an act of the New York State Legislature on April 3, 1807. Randel surveyed the island of Manhattan and is credited with creating the resulting map, or plan. The survey is considered the foundational master plan of New York City, superimposing a grid of 155 numbered streets and 12 avenues on the topography of the island to mark its future development northward. The manuscript plan, entitled ""A Map of the City of New York by the Commissioners appointed by an act of the Legislature passed April 3rd 1807,"" is dated March 22, 1811 and bears the signatures and seals of the three commissioners, Governeur Morris, Simeon De Witt, and John Rutherfurd, as attested by John Randel, Jr. and Archibald Campbell. It was signed by DeWitt Clinton, Mayor of New York City, on May 4, 1811. The plan is accompanied by the Commissioners' manuscript report containing remarks on the plan, which is similarly signed, dated and attested (13 p., bound). Also present is a New York Public Library scrapbook of correspondence and memoranda  relative to the transfer of the plan from the Office of the President of the Borough of Manhattan to the Library, 1935-1936, and its conservation treatment, description and display. It includes a negative photostat of the commissioners' report, as well as two full-size negative photostats of the plan, each mounted on cloth and folded in a pocket portfolio, showing its condition before and after treatment.","Publications About Described Materials Note: Researchers should consult The Greatest Grid: The Master Plan of Manhattan 1811-2011, Hilary Ballon, editor (New York: Columbia University Press, c2012), for an illustrated history of the survey, plan and report.

The purpose of the WPA program was to create paying jobs for the unemployed at every skill level. The WPA allowed many artists to work full time on their craft for the first time. Students were able to learn new skills, while other artists served as mentors and continued to advance techniques and innovate -- especially in the printmaking field. Most works were produced at the Harlem Arts Community Center in New York City. The WPA provided sophisticated equipment that supported the development of printmaking. The African American artist Dox Thrash developed a new lithographic technique, the Carbonrundum print, which contributed to the popularity of printmaking in the United States. Images from the collection include black sharecroppers, city scenes, unemployment lines, laborers, children in parks, industry, and social protests.

But during these long years of discrimination, before 1936 other guides have been published for the Negro, some are still published, but the majority have gone out of business for various reasons.\n\nIn 1936 the Green Book was only a local publication for Metropolitan New York, the response for copies was so great it was turned into a national issue in 1937 to cover the United States. This guide while lacking in many respects was accepted by thousands of travelers. Through the courtesy of the United States Travel Bureau of which Mr. Chas. A. R. McDowell was the collaborator on Negro Affairs, more valuable information was secured. With the two working together, this guide contained the best ideas for the Negro traveler. Year after year it grew until 1941. ""PM"" one of New York's great white newspapers found out about it. Wrote an article about the guide and praised it highly. At the present time the guide contains 80 pages and lists numerous business places, including whites which cater to the Negro trade.\n\nThere are thousands of first class business places that we don't know about and can't list, which would be glad to serve the traveler, but it is hard to secure listings of these places since we can't secure enough agents to send us the information. Each year before we go to press the new information is included in the new edition.\n\nWhen you are traveling please mention the Green Book, in order that they might know how you found their place of business, as they can see that you are strangers. If they haven't heard about this guide, ask them to get in touch with us so that we might list their place.\n\nIf this guide has proved useful to you on your trips, let us know. If not, tell us also as we appreciate your criticisms and ideas in the improvement of this guide from which you benefit.\n\nThere will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published. That is when we as a race will have equal opportunities and privileges in the United States. It will be a great day for us to suspend this publication for then we can go wherever we please, and without embarrassment. But until that time comes we shall continue to publish this information for your convenience each year.","","Discrimination in public accommodations | Hotels | Bars (Drinking establishments) | Taverns (Inns) | Restaurants | African Americans","","","","","text","Guidebooks","","","","","","","","","","","Pamphlets","Victor H.

Navy -- Officers | United States Exploring Expedition (1838-1842)",1834,1834,1842,"English","Simeon A. Stearns (b. 1815) was a U.S. Marine quartermaster sergeant on board the U.S.S. Vincennes, the flagship of the United States Exploring Expedition (1838-1842) which circumnavigated the world under the command of Lieutenant Charles Wilkes of the U.S. Navy. The Simeon A. Stearns papers consists of one volume containing his journal of the Expedition, 1839-1841, with related writings, 1838-1840. Also present are three letters, one to Simeon A. Stearns dated 1842, and two to his brother Daniel B. Stearns, dated 1834 and 1837. The journal covers voyages in the Pacific Ocean from Polynesia to Sydney, Australia and Antarctica, and then to Tonga and the Fiji Islands via Sydney and New Zealand, 1839-1840. Entries for 1841 concern a land expedition from Fort Nisqually on Puget Sound in Oregon.\n\nStearns’ journal (p. 1-195) begins 1839 August 13 on board the Vincennes in the Tuamotu Archipelago of the South Pacific Ocean, continuing to Tahiti in the Society Islands and then to the Samoan Islands. His sparse entries for a voyage to Antarctica, leaving Sydney 1839 December 26 and returning there 1840 March 10, conclude with a brief account of the voyage (p. 44-45). The Expedition then proceeds to New Zealand, Tonga and the Fiji Islands. Stearns’ account of these voyages ends on 1840 September 5 (p. 153), as the Vincennes sails for Oahu, Hawaii.\n\nJournal entries describe the ship’s present location and weather, general events and the location and activities of other Expedition ships, and encounters with Pacific islanders, European and American settlers, and others. There is mention of landings, provisioning and specimen collecting. Stearns describes his land expedition with members of the Scientific Corps in the attempt to reach Mount Orohena on Tahiti (1839 September 12-18), and the reprisal against the people of Malolo in the Fiji Islands for the deaths of two naval officers (beginning 1840 August 1). In addition to chronological entries for Tahiti and the Fiji Islands, there are extensive notes on their people and customs (Tahiti: p. 127-148; Fiji Islands: p. 52-63, 107, 154-195). Stearns also mentions his readings; describes his work on his shell collection, which he had to relinquish to the Expedition (1840 August); and writes down his thoughts on the nature of civilization with respect to the island societies they encounter. There is little discussion of shipmates or ship matters on board the Vincennes, although he mentions a disciplinary problem with an unnamed Marine (1840 August 14). A few random thoughts are written in Spanish.\n\nRelated writings beginning from the reverse side of the volume consist of a table listing the dated landfalls of the Vincennes for 1838-1840 (“Abstract of a Cruise….”) and a list of officers attached to the Expedition, 1840 April, followed by brief journal entries for 1841 May 17-22 describing an expedition on land out of Fort Nisqually on Puget Sound in Oregon. The rough start of a poem and a list of American poets are also included.\n\nThe collection also contains three letters. One from J.G. Brown to Simeon A. Stearns at Providence, Rhode Island, dated 1842 August 11, asks to meet Stearns so that he can deliver letters from the Navy Department and discuss an important matter “respecting the Ex.Ex. as connected with Captain Wilkes.” Brown was a member of the Expedition’s Scientific Corps. Two letters are addressed to Stearns’ brother Daniel B. Stearns in New Hampshire, both from Winchendon, Massachusetts: one a jocular letter from his friend Russell Brown regarding mutual friends and work at a textile mill, dated 1834; and one from Stearns’ father asking him to write home, dated 1837.","Source of Acquisition Note: MSS 64M15","Scientific expeditions | Voyages around the world | Seafaring life | Oregon | Discovery and exploration","Stearns, Simeon A.

His father, Cyrenus Osborne Ward (1831-1902), was a social reformer, historian, and author of The Ancient Lowly and other books on the history of labor. The papers include personal correspondence, coded research notes, and miscellaneous family and genealogical papers","Biographical or Historical Data Note: Frank Edwin Ward was born in Wysox, Pennsylvania on October 7, 1872, the son of Cyrenus Osborne Ward and Stella Owen Ward. He was educated in music at Columbia University and served as University organist from 1902 to 1913. He also played the organ for Temple Israel and the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity. He held the latter post for forty years (1906-1946). Ward also wrote organ and choir music, and taught music theory at Columbia. He was married to May Corby Ward; they had no children. Mrs. Ward sang soprano in many of the choirs led by her husband.\n\nWard was greatly interested in the history of his own family, including his uncle, the sociologist Lester Frank Ward, and his own father, Cyrenus Osborne Ward. Approximately half of the present collection comprises the papers of the father collected by the son.\n\nC. Osborne Ward was born in western New York on October 28, 1831, the son of Justus and Silence Rolph Ward. When he was a small child, his parents moved to Illinois, where Cyrenus, the seventh of ten children, worked on the family farm until he set off on his own in 1848. Cyrenus Ward traveled much and studied much, both in the manual trades and in the humanities. He taught himself music (he played violin professionally), and studied history, botany, geology, and modern and ancient languages.\n\nRejected for service in the Civil War, Ward took a job in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where he became interested in organized labor. He began to write pamphlets and speeches, and traveled widely abroad, meeting such important international socialist leaders as Karl Marx, and researching the history of primitive laborers. In 1884, he was hired by the United States Geological Survey, and then by the Bureau of Labor, where he worked as a translator and librarian. He wrote several books, the most important being known variously as A History of the Ancient Working People and The Ancient Lowly, privately published in 1887. Long hours, extensive travel, and arduous labor in preparing a second volume wore him out, and he died in Yuma, Arizona, where he had gone for his health after the publication of volume 2 of The Ancient Lowly in 1900.","Labor | History","","","","","text | still image","Photographs | Documents","b11992521","","MssCol 3217","","","","","","","3.5 linear ft.","","","",2,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/6dda53b0-895f-0132-3070-58d385a7b928""a7926ac0-895f-0132-2ee6-58d385a7bbd0",41727,"Ausstattung vornehmer wohnräume","","Streitenfeld, A. | Streitenfeld, L.","1897",1897,"","","","","Draperies | Interior decoration","","","","","still image","Prints","b13984600","","MLO++ (Streitenfeld, A. & L.

He was a lawyer in Baltimore until the American Revolutionary War. After he returned to England, his positions included chief clerk at the Office for Trade in London and colonial agent for the Bahamas. He wrote biographies, poetry and pamphlets on the American colonies and collected a large library of books and manuscripts. The George Chalmers collection, dated 1606-1817, consists of documents relating to the American colonies, writings, and correspondence. Documents include materials on Canada, the Carolinas, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, West Florida, and Indians in North America. Also included are notes for a history of the revolt of the colonies, introductory volume about America under George II, and related materials.","Ownership and Custodial History Note: This collection was originally part of the library of George Chalmers. When Chalmers died in 1825, the library was inherited by his nephew, James Chalmers, and kept intact until his death in 1841. James Chalmers' sister then sold the original Chalmers library to Messrs. Evans, dealers in London. A large portion was purchased by London bookseller Thomas Thorpe, and Colonel Thomas Aspinwall purchased a number of volumes pertaining to the American colonies from him in 1843. Samuel L. M. Barlow later purchased the Aspinwall volumes, which were purchased by the Lenox Library in 1890 after Barlow's death. The remainder of the volumes were purchased from the estate of George Bancroft in 1893.","History | Colonies | Indians of North America","","Canada | Connecticut | Florida | Georgia | Great Britain | America | Maryland | New York (State) | North Carolina | Nova Scotia | Pennsylvania | Rhode Island | South Carolina | United States | Virginia","1763-1867 | To 1763 (New France) | Colonial period, ca. 1600-1775 | To 1763","","text","Documents","b11822957","","MssCol 507","","","","","","NYPW93-A180","4.01 linear feet (2 boxes, 27 volumes, 2 oversized folders)","","","",9,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/7cf43260-a5b8-0132-dcbb-58d385a7b928""d446b300-ab05-0132-bbd9-58d385a7b928",41831,"Vogue pattern book","International Vogue pattern book","",1925,1925,1972,"English","","Source Note: Title varies: Oct. 1925-July, 1927, Vogue fashion bi-monthly; Vogue pattern book international, Feb/Mar. 1969-Apr/May, 1970; International Vogue pattern book, Feb./Mar. 1968-Dec. 1968/Jan. 1969, Jun./Jul. 1970-Dec. 1971/Jan. 1972.","Dressmaking | Periodicals | Patterns (Design elements)","","","","","still image | text","Periodicals | Illustrated periodicals","b10256668","","N-10 93","","","","","","","illus. 29-23 cm.","","The Condé Nast Publications","Greenwich, Conn",1,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/d446b300-ab05-0132-bbd9-58d385a7b928""298cc4a0-ab0c-0132-8959-58d385a7bbd0",41833,"McCall pattern book","","",1913,1913,1958,"English","","Note: Vol. for 1928 includes separately paged supplment called McCall needlework and decorative arts.","Dressmaking | Patterns | Fashion | Periodicals","","","","","still image","Periodicals | Periodical illustrations","b11651185","","VSA+ (McCall fashion book)","","","","","","","v. ill. 28-35 cm.","","McCall Co.","New York",2,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/298cc4a0-ab0c-0132-8959-58d385a7bbd0""836c3800-ab18-0132-5924-58d385a7bbd0",41834,"Ritratto Di Roma Moderna: All'Eminentiss. e Reuerendiss.

With the participation of Samuel Adams and others, the Committee prepared statements of the colonists’ rights and the violation of those rights by Great Britain, and sent them to other Massachusetts towns in pamphlet form, asking for their support and advice. In response to what became known as the Boston Pamphlet, similar committees formed in towns across Massachusetts and in other American colonies, helping to create a network of colonial communication ultimately leading to independence from Great Britain. The Boston Committee of Correspondence records, dated 1772-1784, document the Committee’s initiatives in colonial political action in Massachusetts, from the writing of the Boston Pamphlet in November 1772 through the early months of war with Great Britain in 1775, as well as the Committee's contact with other colonies. The records also document its continued work as the Committee of Correspondence, Inspection and Safety, 1777-1784, largely concerned with investigating suspected enemies of the American cause.","Funding Information Note: Digitization was made possible by a lead gift from The Polonsky Foundation.","History | Politics and government | Causes | Committees of correspondence | American loyalists","","Massachusetts | United States","Colonial period, ca. 1600-1775 | Revolution, 1775-1783 | 1775-1783 | To 1775","","text","Documents | minute books","b14421947","","MssCol 343","","","","","","","2.4 linear feet 8 boxes, 1 oversized folder","","","",258,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/96a3f7b0-d01a-0132-bb27-58d385a7b928""c480ee40-d4be-0132-8339-58d385a7b928",41891,"Silas Deane letters","","Deane, Silas, 1737-1789 | Cushing, Thomas, 1725-1788 | Mumford, Thomas, 1728-1799 | Webb, Samuel Blachley, 1753-1807 | Webb, Sarah",1767,1767,1785,"English","Silas Deane (1737-1789) was an American lawyer and merchant, member of the Continental Congress from Connecticut, 1774-1776, and Congressional agent and diplomat in France, 1776-1778.

Included is a brief letter from Haiti's president Jean-Pierre Boyer, declaring any individual on Haitian soil automatically free and beyond pursuit. Correspondence and other documents of Comte de Leaumont, Saint-Domingue-born ex-plantation owner and president of an association of former French settlers dispossessed by the Haitian revolution, including a memoir by Georges Christophe Wurtz, a medical doctor, ""on the means to repair the harm done to French trade by the insurrection in Saint-Domingue"" (1802-1822).
