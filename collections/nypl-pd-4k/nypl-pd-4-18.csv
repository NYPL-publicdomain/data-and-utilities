He was a lawyer in Baltimore until the American Revolutionary War. After he returned to England, his positions included chief clerk at the Office for Trade in London and colonial agent for the Bahamas. He wrote biographies, poetry and pamphlets on the American colonies and collected a large library of books and manuscripts. The George Chalmers collection, dated 1606-1817, consists of documents relating to the American colonies, writings, and correspondence. Documents include materials on Canada, the Carolinas, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, West Florida, and Indians in North America. Also included are notes for a history of the revolt of the colonies, introductory volume about America under George II, and related materials.","Ownership and Custodial History Note: This collection was originally part of the library of George Chalmers. When Chalmers died in 1825, the library was inherited by his nephew, James Chalmers, and kept intact until his death in 1841. James Chalmers' sister then sold the original Chalmers library to Messrs. Evans, dealers in London. A large portion was purchased by London bookseller Thomas Thorpe, and Colonel Thomas Aspinwall purchased a number of volumes pertaining to the American colonies from him in 1843. Samuel L. M. Barlow later purchased the Aspinwall volumes, which were purchased by the Lenox Library in 1890 after Barlow's death. The remainder of the volumes were purchased from the estate of George Bancroft in 1893.","History | Colonies | Indians of North America","","Canada | Connecticut | Florida | Georgia | Great Britain | America | Maryland | New York (State) | North Carolina | Nova Scotia | Pennsylvania | Rhode Island | South Carolina | United States | Virginia","1763-1867 | To 1763 (New France) | Colonial period, ca. 1600-1775 | To 1763","","text","Documents","b11822957","","MssCol 507","","","","","","NYPW93-A180","4.01 linear feet (2 boxes, 27 volumes, 2 oversized folders)","","","",9,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/7cf43260-a5b8-0132-dcbb-58d385a7b928"

The bank offered a safe place to keep the immigrants' money and a way to send money home to destitute relatives. The society's officers also served as officers of the bank, and the society sent remittances overseas through the agency of the bank. The official business of the society, still extant although inactive, is conducted by the bank. Collection consists of selected records of the Emigrant Savings Bank, particularly records pertaining to the Irish Emigrant Society and data about the bank's depositors and borrowers. Irish Emigrant Society records, 1841-1933, include minutes of the board of trustees and finance committee, and an account ledger. Bank records contain information about deposit accounts, real estate, buildings, and investments. Society and bank records document the social history of Irish immigrants on either side of the Atlantic, with occasional references to German and French immigrants. Deposit accounts often contain detailed personal and genealogical information about individual depositors.","","Banks and banking | Immigrants | Irish | Irish-Americans | Societies, etc | Real estate investment | Emigration and immigration | Social conditions","Irish Emigrant Society | Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank | Emigrant Savings Bank","New York (State) | New York (N.Y.) | United States | Ireland","","","text","minutes | Documents | records","b12351335","","*R-USLHG *ZI-815 [Microfilm]","","","","","","","16.2 linear feet (2 boxes, 58 v.); 59 microfilm reels","","","",16,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/ab5b5760-ecf4-0132-cd8c-58d385a7b928"
