His father, Cyrenus Osborne Ward (1831-1902), was a social reformer, historian, and author of The Ancient Lowly and other books on the history of labor. The papers include personal correspondence, coded research notes, and miscellaneous family and genealogical papers","Biographical or Historical Data Note: Frank Edwin Ward was born in Wysox, Pennsylvania on October 7, 1872, the son of Cyrenus Osborne Ward and Stella Owen Ward. He was educated in music at Columbia University and served as University organist from 1902 to 1913. He also played the organ for Temple Israel and the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity. He held the latter post for forty years (1906-1946). Ward also wrote organ and choir music, and taught music theory at Columbia. He was married to May Corby Ward; they had no children. Mrs. Ward sang soprano in many of the choirs led by her husband.\n\nWard was greatly interested in the history of his own family, including his uncle, the sociologist Lester Frank Ward, and his own father, Cyrenus Osborne Ward. Approximately half of the present collection comprises the papers of the father collected by the son.\n\nC. Osborne Ward was born in western New York on October 28, 1831, the son of Justus and Silence Rolph Ward. When he was a small child, his parents moved to Illinois, where Cyrenus, the seventh of ten children, worked on the family farm until he set off on his own in 1848. Cyrenus Ward traveled much and studied much, both in the manual trades and in the humanities. He taught himself music (he played violin professionally), and studied history, botany, geology, and modern and ancient languages.\n\nRejected for service in the Civil War, Ward took a job in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where he became interested in organized labor. He began to write pamphlets and speeches, and traveled widely abroad, meeting such important international socialist leaders as Karl Marx, and researching the history of primitive laborers. In 1884, he was hired by the United States Geological Survey, and then by the Bureau of Labor, where he worked as a translator and librarian. He wrote several books, the most important being known variously as A History of the Ancient Working People and The Ancient Lowly, privately published in 1887. Long hours, extensive travel, and arduous labor in preparing a second volume wore him out, and he died in Yuma, Arizona, where he had gone for his health after the publication of volume 2 of The Ancient Lowly in 1900.","Labor | History","","","","","text | still image","Photographs | Documents","b11992521","","MssCol 3217","","","","","","","3.5 linear ft.","","","",2,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/6dda53b0-895f-0132-3070-58d385a7b928"

""Blackwork"" here refers to a style of ornamental engravings executed in Northern Europe between the 1580s and the 1620s to provide enameling designs for jewelers; chief distinguishing characteristic is the inclusion of areas of solid black. The style was formerly known in English as niello (distinct from the earlier Italian engraving style) or silhouette style. Cf. Christie, R. ""Blackwork prints : designs for enamelling,"" in Print quarterly, v. 5, no. 1 (Mar. 1988), p. 4-20.","Source of Acquisition Note: Purchase; Susan Schulman, Printseller; 2011/11/08","Decoration and ornament, Baroque | Jewelry | Design | Enamel and enameling","","France","","","still image","Pattern books | Prints","b19658544","","Spencer Coll.

He was a lawyer in Baltimore until the American Revolutionary War. After he returned to England, his positions included chief clerk at the Office for Trade in London and colonial agent for the Bahamas. He wrote biographies, poetry and pamphlets on the American colonies and collected a large library of books and manuscripts. The George Chalmers collection, dated 1606-1817, consists of documents relating to the American colonies, writings, and correspondence. Documents include materials on Canada, the Carolinas, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, West Florida, and Indians in North America. Also included are notes for a history of the revolt of the colonies, introductory volume about America under George II, and related materials.","Ownership and Custodial History Note: This collection was originally part of the library of George Chalmers. When Chalmers died in 1825, the library was inherited by his nephew, James Chalmers, and kept intact until his death in 1841. James Chalmers' sister then sold the original Chalmers library to Messrs. Evans, dealers in London. A large portion was purchased by London bookseller Thomas Thorpe, and Colonel Thomas Aspinwall purchased a number of volumes pertaining to the American colonies from him in 1843. Samuel L. M. Barlow later purchased the Aspinwall volumes, which were purchased by the Lenox Library in 1890 after Barlow's death. The remainder of the volumes were purchased from the estate of George Bancroft in 1893.","History | Colonies | Indians of North America","","Canada | Connecticut | Florida | Georgia | Great Britain | America | Maryland | New York (State) | North Carolina | Nova Scotia | Pennsylvania | Rhode Island | South Carolina | United States | Virginia","1763-1867 | To 1763 (New France) | Colonial period, ca. 1600-1775 | To 1763","","text","Documents","b11822957","","MssCol 507","","","","","","NYPW93-A180","4.01 linear feet (2 boxes, 27 volumes, 2 oversized folders)","","","",9,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/7cf43260-a5b8-0132-dcbb-58d385a7b928"

With the participation of Samuel Adams and others, the Committee prepared statements of the colonists’ rights and the violation of those rights by Great Britain, and sent them to other Massachusetts towns in pamphlet form, asking for their support and advice. In response to what became known as the Boston Pamphlet, similar committees formed in towns across Massachusetts and in other American colonies, helping to create a network of colonial communication ultimately leading to independence from Great Britain. The Boston Committee of Correspondence records, dated 1772-1784, document the Committee’s initiatives in colonial political action in Massachusetts, from the writing of the Boston Pamphlet in November 1772 through the early months of war with Great Britain in 1775, as well as the Committee's contact with other colonies. The records also document its continued work as the Committee of Correspondence, Inspection and Safety, 1777-1784, largely concerned with investigating suspected enemies of the American cause.","Funding Information Note: Digitization was made possible by a lead gift from The Polonsky Foundation.","History | Politics and government | Causes | Committees of correspondence | American loyalists","","Massachusetts | United States","Colonial period, ca. 1600-1775 | Revolution, 1775-1783 | 1775-1783 | To 1775","","text","Documents | minute books","b14421947","","MssCol 343","","","","","","","2.4 linear feet 8 boxes, 1 oversized folder","","","",258,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/96a3f7b0-d01a-0132-bb27-58d385a7b928"

Silas Deane letters, dated 1767-1785, are addressed to his stepchildren Sarah (Sally) Webb and Samuel Blachley Webb, and friends Thomas Mumford and Thomas Cushing, New England merchants and politicians. Letters to Sally in Boston, 1767-1769, mention her mother's illness and offer advice for Sally's education and self-improvement. His 1778 letter to Thomas Cushing in Boston asks him to assist Sally, now the widow of John Simpson, a Loyalist. Letters written at Philadelphia to Thomas Mumford in Connecticut, 1774-1775, tell of Congressional business and colonial disputes, his participation in the Secret Committee to obtain support from Europe, and the need to develop an American naval force. Deane's letter of July 16, 1785 at London to Samuel Blachley Webb gives a careful study of American commercial prospects and Great Britain's rising manufacturing economy. A letter dated March 7, 1779 addressing ""my Dear Col[onel],"" and referring to an exchange, may be addressed to Samuel Blachley Webb, at that time an American army colonel and prisoner of war.","Funding Information Note: Digitization was made possible by a lead gift from The Polonsky Foundation.","Commerce | Social life and customs | History | Politics and government","Deane, Silas, 1737-1789","Great Britain | United States | New England","to 1775 | Revolution, 1775-1783 | 1775-1783","","text","Correspondence","b19840587","","MssCol 4310","","","","","","",".1 linear feet 1 folder","","","",11,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/c480ee40-d4be-0132-8339-58d385a7b928"
