Included are records of the Gay Activists Alliance, the Gay Alliance of Brooklyn, Gay Switchboard of New York, the Mattachine Society Inc. of New York, and records of miscellaneous organizations including Christopher Street That New Magazine, Inc., and the periodicals Gaysweek, and New York Native. Personal papers include papers of Lockett Ford Ballard, Jr., Arthur Bell, Billy Wilder Blackwell, Perry Brass, Robert Clement, Don Jackson, Walter Porczak, and Sam Staggs. There are also miscellaneous records of IGIC, including correspondence, minutes, memoranda, photographs of gay rights demonstrations, scripts of plays by gay writers, and printed ephemera issued by gay, lesbian and AIDS organizations in the United States.|||Audiovisual materials include recorded interviews with gay leaders such as Hal (Harold) Call, Curtis Dewees, Franklin Kameny, James Kepner, Morris Kight, Henry (Harry) Hay, Dorr Legg, and Donald Lucas, which chronicle the history of early gay and lesbian organizations such as the Mattachine Society, One, Inc., the Daughters of Bilitis, the Society for Individual Rights, and the Gay Liberation Front. There are also sound recordings of a number of radio and television programs on gay-related issues, most of which were broadcast on Pacifica Radio stations in the early 1980s. These record news and issues of concern to the gay community, such as bias crimes, homophobia, and the spread of AIDS. In addition, the collection includes recordings of lectures, conferences, public forums, and other meetings organized by gay and lesbian groups, some of which include performances by gay entertainers. Most of these gatherings took place in the New York City area in the late 1970s or early 1980s. Audiovisual materials also include television programs (and outtakes) produced in the early 1970s for broadcast on Open Channel, a public access cable channel in New York City. In addition, there are two erotic films, and a documentary entitled, ""A Gay View/Male,"" which was released in 1974.","Biographical or Historical Data Note: The International Gay Information Center, Inc. (IGIC) was founded in New York City in 1982 for the purpose of collecting and preserving historical records and papers which document the movement for gay rights in America. Since its founding the IGIC has collected the records of organizations and the papers of individuals who have been active in the gay rights movement.It has also collected and preserved an extensive file of gay periodicals and imprints; audio-visual materials; and a large mass of printed and near-printed ephemera which document the social and political activities and events of local gay organizations and groups in various cities throughout America.

The documents are all from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, except for a chronology of the history of blacks in Uruguay from 1680-1990.\nIncluded in the official documents are a number of royal decrees concerning the commerce in Africans, the education, treatment and occupation of enslaved laborers, and the liberation of fugitives from the territories of imperial rivals. Other decrees include an 1810 Mexican prohibition against intermarriage between those of ""known nobility and pure blood and blacks, mulattos and other castes"" and an 1812 decree tackling the education of Spanish subjects of African origin in Mexico.\nSignificant in the collection's family papers are the Magan family legal documents which contain a history of an Argentinian family's slave holdings, and records matriarch Inez de Cabrera y Magan's dying wish to grant freedom to her enslaved woman, Josefa. In addition to the Magan family papers, there are a number of other private legal documents that deal with the sale and manumission of enslaved people.\nA 1778 population register of 28 Puerto Rican cities and an 1815 record of the free black population in Buenos Aires offer a demographic picture of colonial Spanish America as do a 1753 Venezuela plantation inventory, a 1775 Cuban population register and a series of handwritten reports regarding maroons in Cuba's Matanzas Province (1837-1838).","Blacks | History | Social conditions | Slavery | Slave trade | Slaves | Enslaved people","","Latin America | Haiti | Argentina | Cuba | Peru | Mexico | Venezuela | Uruguay | West Indies","","","text","correspondence | documents","b18401028","","Sc MG 418","","","","","","",".5 linear feet (2 boxes)","","","",3,"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/f7ddf6d0-c608-012f-02d6-58d385a7bc34""26fd6800-c609-012f-dc85-58d385a7bc34",28403,"Stoli︠t︡sa i usadʹba","","",1913,1913,1917,"Russian","","Source Note: Library has: no. 1-90","Art","","Russia","","","still image | text","Periodicals","b16008353","","Slav.

He was elected to New York's colonial assembly in 1768, was a delegate to the second Continental Congress, served in the New York State Senate from 1780 to 1784 and 1786 to 1790, and became one of New York's first U.S. senators, 1797-1798. During the Revolutionary War he commanded the Continental Army forces of the Northern Dept. Schuyler was involved in the commercial development of New York and his navigation companies constructed the canals that formed the basis of the Erie Canal system. Collection consists of correspondence, accounts, military records, land records, and other papers documenting the military, political and business activities and family affairs of Schuyler. Correspondence, 1761-1804, is with military officers, members of the Continental Congress, committees of safety, and family, and concerns the conduct of the Revolutionary War in the Northern Dept., 1775-1777, and political and personal matters. Indian papers, 1710-1797, contain Schuyler's papers as Commissioner of Indian Affairs in the Northern Dept. during the war and as agent of New York State. Canal papers, 1792-1803, include correspondence, diaries, reports, surveys, accounts, and other papers relating to the construction of canals in New York. His papers as Surveyor General of New York State, 1773-1788, and public papers, ca. 1775-1796, consist of correspondence, receipts, drafts of legislation and proposals, building plans, and other papers. Financial and legal papers, 1711-1805, estate papers, 1755-1809, and land papers, 1684-1840, pertain to business activities and land holdings. Family papers, 1772-1851, contain correspondence and other papers of Schuyler family members. Military papers, 1775-1777, comprise Revolutionary War materials that were neither generated nor received directly by Schuyler.","Biographical or Historical Data Note: Philip John Schuyler (1733-1804) was a prominent member of the landed aristocracy of upstate New York. Born in Albany, Schuyler inherited extensive lands in the Saratoga Patent, through the Mohawk Valley, in Dutchess County, and along the Hudson River. He served in the British Army during the French and Indian War, rising to the rank of Major. His thirty year career in public office began in 1768 when he was elected to New York's colonial assembly. There he sided with those favoring increased independence from Great Britain. He was a delegate to the second Continental Congress and was made one of the four Major-Generals in the Continental Army under Washington. During the Revolutionary War he commanded the forces of the Northern Department, 1775-1777, until replaced by Horatio Gates. However, he remained in his post as Commissioner of Indian Affairs and was re-elected to the Continental Congress, 1778-1781. He served in the New York State Senate, 1780-1784 and 1786-1790, and became one of New York's first United States Senators, 1797-1798. Schuyler was also deeply involved in the commercial development of New York. He oversaw the construction of saw mills, gristmills, and New York's first flax mill, exported timber and other products of his estates via his Hudson River fleet, and took a leading role in the development of better transportation. As president and leading force in the creation and incorporation of the Northern Inland Lock Navigation Company and the Western Inland Lock Navigation Company, he constructed the canals that would form the basis of the great Erie Canal system.","","Schuyler, Philip John, 1733-1804","","","","text | still image","","b11985422","","MssCol 2701","","","","","","","Originals: 21 linear feet (56 boxes, 15 v.)

Materials are from bases in the United States, Germany, Korea, and Japan, and span the late 1940s to the 1970s. Many of these shows are popular stage musicals such as The Fantasticks, The Pajama Game, Guys and Dolls; also represented are non-musical plays such as The Odd Couple and Inherit the Wind. Of special note are a collection of post World War II scrapbooks from bases in Germany, dating back to 1949, documenting plays and musical productions there.","Biographical or Historical Data Note: Miss Lynn was named Margaret Eleanor Linskie at her birth in Dallas on April 24, 1921, and she originally intended to be a concert pianist. She studied at Northwestern University and graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1942. She earned a master's degree in speech and drama from Catholic University.\n\nIn 1945, she was one of the first civilian ""actress technicians"" employed by the United States government to work with troops overseas after World War II. She conceived and directed shows during the Korean War, bringing entertainment to United Nations units, sometimes under artillery fire. When she returned to Washington in 1955, she continued working for the Department of the Army, creating and directing a show called ""Rolling Along,"" which toured the world from 1955 to 1961.\n\nIn 1962, she helped push for a new organization to promote and support theatrical and musical productions at Army bases. The result, the Army Music and Theater Program, was a continuation of more informal efforts dating to the Revolutionary War.\n\nAs the director of the Entertainment Services Unit for the United States Army, Miss Lynn's role was to muster talent from privates to colonels, pay royalties to writers and production companies, and provide guidance to aspiring dramatic troupes from Germany to Korea. She supervised a far-flung network of 200 full-time civilian directors in performing arts centers at military bases. Besides having soldiers entertaining soldiers, she encouraged the participation of their family members and civilians from nearby towns. She set up scholarships and competitions to discover and encourage talented soldiers and officers. She pushed successfully to convert unused Army movie houses into spaces for live theater.\n\nIn 1982, she formed her own production company, Creative Consultants, which worked with Disney and other entertainment companies. She was executive director of the American Theater Association from 1982 to 1986.\nMargaret E. Lynn, who directed the Army's extensive, worldwide theatrical program that encouraged participation by soldiers, officers and their dependents, died on June 11, 2002 at a hospital in Fairfax, Va. She was 81.","Music in the army | Soldiers as actors","United States Army's Entertainment Services Unit","","","","text | still image","Photographs | Scrapbooks | Clippings","b14923868","","*T-MSS 1975-004","","","","","","","16 lf.
